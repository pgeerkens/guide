## Greatest Common Factor Calculator

Pseudocode for a GCD (ie Geatest Common Divisor) function for two positive integers:

  - Verify input as two positive integers
  - Set max as the larger and min as the smaller of the inputs
  - While min <> 0:
      - set rem to remainder of max / min
      - set max to min
      - set min to rem
  - Return max
